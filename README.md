# London Fire Brigade Analysis

## Business Problems:
This dataset will be employed to answer the following questions:
* With the assumption that people would not call the LFB falsely for the Special Services, the question is how to accurately predict whether an alarm is false and to determine the risk factors for fires. 
* What is the relationship between property categories and incident groups? Are there specific property categories that are more likely to suffer from fires?
* What are the locations and dates of the fires? Are there more fires during or close to bank holidays?
* Have all the fires in the borough been attended by the local stations? Have the local stations been used for other Fire Service grounds? What are the features of the incidents attended by other stations and is there a difference from the incidents attended by the local stations?
* What does the number of pumps necessary per day depend on? How many pumps should a station have?


## Data Pre-processing
### Data Types
To ensure that the correct datatypes were allocated to each variable `Easting_rounded`, 
`Northing_rounded` and `HourOfCall` needed converting to categorical types.
